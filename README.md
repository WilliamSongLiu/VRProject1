# Fear and Relief

## Context

It’s Halloween. You’ve been out all night trick or treating, and you’ve gathered a backpack full of candy.

It’s getting late. Time to head home. You live with your grandma in a small cabin in the woods.

As you approach your house, you hear a mysterious sound.

## Description

You are trying to get home, but there are some invisible monsters in your way!

This is an experience designed for active audience participation. 2 volunteer monsters will each be holding a controller, while the player with the headset will travel by walking in real space.

The monsters will move toward the player, making slow but loud footsteps.

## Reflection

I was exploring the emotions of fear and relief in my project. Plenty of horror games use these themes, so I aimed to strip away as much as possible and only have the essential component necessary to convey a sense of fear and relief.

I focused on the idea that a prominent type of fear is fear of the unknown. In the game, the player has just enough information to know roughly where the monsters are but is devoid of any other knowledge. The player is unable to see the monsters since they have no graphical representation in game, and the monsters periodically make ambiguous growls that make it hard for the player to mentally put them in a definitive category (zombie, ghost, vampire, alien, etc.).

Reaching your house is used to convey relief. To finally make it to a location the player identifies as a safe spot is designed to contrast with the fear previously experienced.
